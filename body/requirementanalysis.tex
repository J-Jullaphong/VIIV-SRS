\section{Use Case Diagram}
\label{section:use-case-diagram}
<TIP: Write a use case diagram for your project here. Refer to an
article “What is a use case diagram?” by Lucidchart for help./>

\section{Use Case Model}
\label{section:use-case-model}
A use case is a detailed description of how a system
interacts with an external entity (such as a user or another system) to
accomplish a specific goal. Use cases provide a high-level view of the
functionality of a system and help in capturing and documenting its
requirements from the perspective of end users.

<TIP: Write use cases for your project here. Make sure to use the
appropriate type of use case for each scenario (brief, casual, and fully-dressed
use case)./>

Figure \ref{fig:viiv-mockup-ui-chat} illustrates how the chatbot generates 
a structured response with detailed insights when a user enters a prompt 
about stock analysis. In this example, the user requests an analysis of CPALL stock, 
and the chatbot responds by breaking down the information into key sections. 
The response includes internal company factors, such as profitability and expansion plans, 
external influences, like economic conditions and government policies, stock price trends, 
market news, and market indices that impact CPALL’s performance.

Figure \ref{fig:viiv-mockup-ui-visualization} illustrates the chatbot’s response when
a user asks about the stock trend of CPALL. The chatbot provides a detailed analysis, 
summarizing the stock’s movement over different time periods. It breaks down the stock 
trend into key insights, including price range, upward trend, downward trend, 
and consolidation phase. The response highlights the highest and lowest stock prices, 
periods of increase and decline, and possible market corrections.

Additionally, the UI includes a stock price chart at the bottom, which visually 
represents CPALL’s historical price movements using a candlestick chart and moving averages. 
The chart provides investors with a graphical interpretation of price fluctuations over time.
