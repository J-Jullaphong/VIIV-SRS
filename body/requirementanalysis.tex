<TIP: Write a use case diagram for your project here. Refer to an
article “What is a use case diagram?” by Lucidchart for help./>

\section{Use Case Model}
\label{section:use-case-model}
A use case is a detailed description of how a system
interacts with an external entity (such as a user or another system) to
accomplish a specific goal. Use cases provide a high-level view of the
functionality of a system and help in capturing and documenting its
requirements from the perspective of end users.

<TIP: Write use cases for your project here. Make sure to use the
appropriate type of use case for each scenario (brief, casual, and fully-dressed
use case)./>
